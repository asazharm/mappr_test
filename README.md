# Mappr Front End Task - 1

A Reactjs app for true GIF enthusiasts... 

## Project

We would like you to build a web app that displays the trending GIFs on [Giphy](https://giphy.com/).

1. Users visiting the website should see the list of latest 20 trending GIFs. 
2. The user should be able to expand a GIF and see its details (username, rating, anything you think could be relevant).

Users should have a good user experience on desktop, tablet and mobile devices. Choose whatever responsive framework you like. React Bootstrap is agood choice.

This project is pretty open ended in order to leave you some freedom to improve upon the base by focusing on what you like the most.

We strongly encourage you to pick a couple of optional improvements. The following are just some ideas, so if none of these interest you, feel free to do something that isnít on this list:

- Let the user search for GIFs and see a filtered list of results
- Add pagination or lazy load
- When the user scrolls the page to the bottom, load new GIFs automatically.
- Create a mosaic layout and display a placeholder when GIFs are still loading.
- Show off your animation skills!
- Sort the results by uploaded time and let the user choose if they prefer ascending or descending ordering.
- Let the user favorite GIFs and list their favorites. The users should be able to retrieve their favorite GIFs even after refreshing the page.
- Provide the ultimate user experience: scrolling, searching, fetchingÖ could be optimized for UX.
- Let the user upload a GIF.
- Add some unit tests.


### Project Structure

We've included a [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) based starter project in this repository, feel free to use it. 
If you'd prefer to use something other than React or you'd prefer a different project structure, go ahead with your choice.

### Evaluation

The task evaluator should be able to clone the provided code and run the application on any computer by executing `npm install` and `npm start` commands.
Weíll evaluate the exercise by looking at the end result and the code.
